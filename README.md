# speck_assignment

This is a project made as an assignment for the Speck Academy selection process. The task was to create
two HTML (unordered) lists. The lists have to be styled in a certain way. A bit of interactivity is 
accomplished with on-mouse-hover events and adding elements from one list to another.
